# Forged Factions GM Tool
I am building this out as a GM tool for those running Forged in the Dark games such as Blades in the Dark or Scum & Villainy. The goal of this is to fully automate faction advancement for the GM so they can press a single button and get news on what is happening in the city.

# Roadmap
This is the very bare bones list of my plans

## Core App Features
The app will be useable when I have completed:
- [x] The Dice Roller
- [ ] Ability to Create/Save/Load campaigns
- [x] Ability to read Faction lists stored as YAML files
- [ ] Create/Edit those Faction lists
- [ ] Run Advancement and update the save files for your campaign
- [ ] GUI isn't hot trash

## Alpha Release
I will stage some kind of alpha test when I have added:
- [ ] Prompt generation options for the GM, essentially events to notify the players about based upon how far a faction advances

## Beta Release
Beta testing will occur when:
- [ ] Faction interaction options to pit factions against each other
- [ ] Prompt generation based on faction interaction
- [ ] Inclusion of player crew attributes and prompt ideas for factions interacting with them

## Stretch Features
I will likely seek to add these stretch features post-release as a free update or something.
- [ ] Map Integration: I would love to include a feature where the app pings the setting map with the location of events.

# A Note About AI
Please note that the prompt generation features WILL use AI. As such, using those features will have a cost associated with them. My current plans will have variable options for how much processing power GMs want behind prompt generation. I also plan to include local logic for prompt generation eventually in order to cut down costs even more for the end user.
